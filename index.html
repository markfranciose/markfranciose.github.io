		<p>A site to celebrate the culture, traditions and beauty of Slovakia. Including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="castles.html">Castles of Slovakia</a></li>
			<li><a href="food.html">Slovak Cuisine</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>For more information about Slovakia, you can <a href="http://slovakia.travel/en">visit here</a>. This site has nice visual styling, and is avialable in a number of different languages via the section at the top of the page, although the translation in English lacks in some places. It presents a lot of information and via the menus at the top and the bottom it's pretty easily accessible.</p>
