		<p><strong>Slovak Plum Jam</strong><br>
		Slovak Plum Jam is thick and sugary, and very delicious. 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Bryndza</strong><br>
		Bryndza is a sheep's cheese which is produced and sold all over Slovakia. Finding good quality bryndza is the United States is quite a chore!
		</p>
		<p><strong>Saurkraut</strong><br>
		Slovak saurkraut is often sweetened with a larger touch of sugar after it has been packaged. This gives a interesting and different charachter to all of the savory dishes in which it's used.
